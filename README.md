# LIver_Disease_Prediction
Created a predictive model with implementation of  different classifiers on liver patient diseases dataset to predict liver diseases.
Age : Age is the Age of the Patient in Year

Gender : Gender is the sex of Patient

Total Bilirubin: Bilirubin is a yellow pigment produced during the breakdown of red blood cells. Elevated levels of total bilirubin in the blood can indicate liver problems.

Direct Bilirubin: Direct bilirubin refers to the conjugated form of bilirubin that is excreted from the liver into the bile. Elevated levels of direct bilirubin can be an indication of liver diseases or bile duct obstruction.

Alkaline Phosphatase: Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is an enzyme . Elevated levels of ALP in the blood can indicate liver disorders.

Alamine Aminotransferase (ALT): ALT is an enzyme found primarily in the liver. Increased levels of ALT can indicate liver damage .

Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST): AST is an enzyme . Elevated levels of AST can indicate liver damage, heart problems, or muscle injury.

Total Proteins: Total proteins refer to the total amount of proteins present in the blood, including albumin and globulins. Abnorml levels of total proteins can indicate various medical conditions, including liver or kidney diseases.

Albumin: Albumin is a protein synthesized by the liver. Low levels of albumin in the blood can be indicative of liver disease or malnutrition.

Albumin and Globulin Ratio: The albumin and globulin ratio is calculated by dividing the albumin level by the globulin level. This ratio can provide additional information about liver function .

Target : The patient have Liver Disease or not.



The Random Forest model achieved the highest test accuracy (82.93%) among all models, followed closely by XGBoost with a test accuracy of 81.30%. The Random Forest model also had the highest F1 score (82.50%), indicating its overall good performance in terms of precision and recall. Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Gradient Boosting also performed reasonably well with F1 scores above 74 .

So that why i am prefering Random forest .
